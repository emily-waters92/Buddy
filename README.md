## Teamwork principles

### Decision making
*How will you make decisions together*
- One person has that final say, product owner - Ado 
- If want to push ourselves with new tech, everyone has to agree
- Stand-ups within seperate teams  (set times) (front-end, back-end, if we choose to do so) 
- Voting system, if not decision was unable to be made by voting, (50/50) product owner (Ado) makes final decision. 
- One standup in the morning (9am), one before lunch (11:45), end of the day (4:30). Naturally works with break points. 

### Feedback 
*How / when will you give each other feedback during the project**
- Feedbacking one to one - address it rather than let it simmer. Not let it fester. Pull them to one side, communicate on what happened and your feelings. If you canâ€™t resolve it by yourself bring in a facilitator. Also ask someone if they want your feedback as well, as some will be open to feedback, and sometimes you may not want to hear it.
- If feedback is not urgent, save till the end of the day 
- Standup round 
- Retros feedbacking on the day  
- No set time, if you have feedback to give, ask the person if they want to receive feedback at that time. 



### General principles
*How will you ensure that everyone in your team has an opportunity to feel included and contribute effectively*
- Making sure we are not talking to fast 
- Ensuring that everyone is heard and  understood
- If there is something in particular you are keen to do, talk to the group about. Be transparent by actively checking in with others and communicating issues 
- Everyone has at least one minute to have something to say in standups. 
- Process over product 
- If your not happy in what youâ€™re doing, say something. - open communication
- Donâ€™t struggle for longer than 10-15 minutes, the more frustrated you get, it will ruin the mood. 


### Communication
*What routines will you put in place to ensure consistent communication between team members*
- Each person has one minute to talk in stand-ups 
- First, how are you doing
- Second, what are you unto, or where are you unto - More expanded for the retro. 
- Making sure we are talking in the slack as well if something happens. 


### Conflicts
*How will you use Non Violent Communication (NVC) techniques*
- Considering feelings
- Objectively state the facts
- See where they are coming from 
- Donâ€™t make emotionally charged comments. 
- Be open, honest and transparent
- If there is conflict that arises, take time away, before reacting in the moment. (Tell that person that you feel uncomfortable before you leave though) 
- Then going through points, and approach the situation. 

*How will you incorporate regular (wellbeing) check-ins? When and how will you do this*
- Stand of our stand-ups, and check ins. Checking in to see how everyone is feeling. And that way you know someone is not just being an ass they just donâ€™t feel well. 


### Schedule 

*When will you schedule breaks*

Scheduled breaks: 
12 - 2 

What days will you work, and what days will you take a break?	 
Times coming in:
- Estrella 9-5
- Jen 9-5
- Ado 9-5
- Josh 9-5
- Lou 9-5
- Emily 9-5
Along as it doesnâ€™t impact other people, can work outside of those hours. Structural stuff, donâ€™t touch. 
Weekend is off, but if people choose to come in thatâ€™s fine. Unless MVP not achieved. Let people know if youâ€™re not coming in. 


### Wellbeing
*How will you share your wellbeing needs with each other*
- Stress profile
- If something changes, super urgent, rally everyone. But pop in the slack if you canâ€™t come in. Or even if you just need to go out for a walk chuck it in the slack. 
- That way we donâ€™t leave people in the dark. And we can be more on that persons side. 
- In terms of being stressed, vocalise it to someone 


**Josh:**
- Stress: Quiter, swear under breath, seems like havenâ€™t made any headway on a ticket sign,  getting tunnel vision and stress
- What we can do to help: Josh will ask for help from a facilitator, taking time out (water, fresh air). someone else to talk to  about how they are struggling. 

**Lou:**
- Stress: Short with people, hurried, 
- What we can do to help: Plan and organised, have structure, entertain the idea of creating a plan with me, can we make a plan to make a plan Just needs a moment or a walk

**Jen:**
- Stress: Tunnel vision, separating self, trying to get into  it
- What can we do to help: Ask for help, little break, change what youâ€™re doing, eat something 

**Estrella:**
- Stress: Short, isolate myself, 
- What can we do to help: Get a hot choccie as a break

**Ado:** 
- Stress: Panic, (rushing, not really careful with making decision), stay inside head, fasting (morning will be fine, afternoon head doesnâ€™t work (get headache))
- What can we do to telp: Not making decision a lot, tell you what to do. 

**Emily:**
- Stress: Shut down, face goes stone, remove myself (or need to remove myself) need a breather. 
- What can we do to help: Just check in if iâ€™m alright. Talking things out, get off chest, push to side and let it go. 



How will we survive? 
- We donâ€™t need to force eating together. We take our break at the same time, but can choose how we spend that time. 
- If you see someone has done something that doesnâ€™t work, tell that person (I donâ€™t feel like we are doing it right, can we talk about it) 
- Fun: balancing stressful, go for a walk, set aside a morning tea time to just talk and bring us together as a group. Take a break from tech and do something together, even if itâ€™s a little cringey.
